I've been reflecting on my research process lately, particularly on how to navigate the vast landscape of ideas and effectively leverage AI as a thinking partner. This post outlines the core principles and workflows I've developed for myself.

## On Action and Overcoming Inertia

1.  **The brain is inherently lazy; it seeks to conserve energy.** How, then, can we activate its deep thinking mode? My primary method is **writing**. By externalizing my entire logical chain and articulating my points of confusion, I find that my brain spontaneously starts to seek answers and crave more input. Writing is not just for documenting thoughts, but for generating them.

2.  **A structured approach to ideation is crucial.** My process involves first generating a diverse set of 5-10 novel and logically sound ideas. Only after this divergent phase do I begin the convergent process of searching for related papers. This allows me to assess each idea based on its feasibility, originality, and whether it builds upon existing foundations. This filtering process typically reveals that some ideas lack novelty, are too grandiose without prior groundwork, or have already been implemented. After this initial screening, only a few viable ideas remain. I then engage in an intensive discussion with an AI to refine them further, leaving me with a single, robust idea to propose to my advisor.

3.  **Physical health and energy are integral components of research capability.** A well-maintained biological system is the foundation for a high-performing cognitive system. Neglecting it inevitably leads to a domino effect of setbacks.

## On Working with AI

1.  **AI often acts as a sycophant—an echo chamber and amplifier for your own thoughts.** This can be incredibly powerful for deepening and accelerating a well-formed idea. However, it can also enthusiastically endorse concepts that are overly ambitious or practically infeasible. My solution is to employ a **"dual-AI" strategy**: I open a new chat window and instruct a second AI to act as an "extremely harsh critic." I then let these two AIs engage in a dialectic, a process of "sparring" that pressure-tests the idea from both supportive and adversarial perspectives.

2.  **An AI is fundamentally a sequence prediction engine; it lacks true originality.** We cannot expect it to generate brilliant, novel ideas from scratch. My approach is to **guide it**. I provide the AI with a comprehensive chain of thought—my existing knowledge, my reasoning across different domains, and my logical framework. By prompting it to follow this chain step-by-step, the AI's output becomes significantly more innovative and feasible.

*P.S. I later realized these two methods are analogous to classic LLM training techniques: the first is a form of **Self-Critique**, and the second is a form of **Thought Distillation**.*
