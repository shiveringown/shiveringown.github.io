My name is Chuyan Li, and I am a rising sophomore student at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. You can reach me via email at: 12413155[at]mail.sustech.edu.cn.

My current research interest lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Cognitive Science**. I am particularly fascinated by the foundational challenges in **AI Alignment and Safety**, as well as the emergent properties of **Neurosymbolic AI**. My long-term goal is to pursue a Ph.D. and contribute to the development of safe, robust, and human-compatible AI systems.

I am actively seeking research opportunities (especially for summer 2026) that align with my interests. Please feel free to explore my projects and publications, and do not hesitate to get in touch.

## Research Interests
*   AI Alignment and Safety
*   Neurosymbolic AI
*   AI Ethics and Governance
*   Interpretable Machine Learning
*   Natural Language Processing
