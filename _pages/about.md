# Chuyan Li 

I am a rising sophomore at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. **Xuetao Wei**, under whose guidance I am exploring the foundational challenges of building safe and trustworthy AI.

My research passion lies at the intersection of **AI Alignment, Cognitive Science, and Neurosymbolic AI**. I am driven by a fundamental question: How can we build AI systems that not only demonstrate intelligent behavior but also understand and align with the complex, nuanced, and often conflicting fabric of human values? My work aims to move beyond surface-level behavioral fixes, seeking to imbue AI with more robust, interpretable, and human-compatible reasoning abilities.

My long-term aspiration is to pursue a Ph.D. and contribute to the development of verifiably safe and beneficial AI. I am actively seeking research internship opportunities for **Summer 2026** and beyond that align with this vision.

## Research Interests

*   **AI Alignment & Safety**: Investigating the brittleness of current alignment techniques (e.g., RLHF) and exploring novel frameworks for value representation and intent recognition.
*   **Neurosymbolic AI**: Leveraging symbolic reasoning and knowledge structures to enhance the transparency, robustness, and causal understanding of neural models.
*   **Interpretable Machine Learning**: Developing methods to "open the black box" of LLMs, particularly in the context of their ethical and safety-critical behaviors.
*   **AI Ethics & Governance**: Exploring the societal implications of advanced AI and the technical foundations for effective governance.
